# Agent Hooks

This directory contains agent hooks for automated workflows.

Agent hooks can be triggered by various events:
- When a message is sent to the agent
- When an agent execution completes
- When a new session is created
- When a user saves a code file

## Creating Hooks

Use the command palette to 'Open Kiro Hook UI' to create new hooks.
